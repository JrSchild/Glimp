## Glimp Proposal
A social app that turns social media around.

### The idea
Glimp lets users ask for a glimp (glimpse) in someone’s life. The user is in control of who he/she wants content from and when. The content sent is unique because users are only able to send the pictures to one person. The glimps are from a speficifc moment and the user the user can set a timer for how much time the responded has to answer. All Glimps are collected and can only be seen by the user him/her self.

#### Advantages
- Catch a glimpse into someone’s life whenever you want
- Unique content
- 1 on 1 personal content
- Only content from users you selected
- Playful and exciting
- No longer a Facebook-feed with stuff you don’t want
- Interest-span is always high

#### Functionalities
- User login/registration
- Add friends
- Add a profile picture
- Ask for a glimp with a timer
- Answer a glimp (take a photo)
- View shared glimps

### Possible Complications
This is a timesensitive project, so there is not much room for error. A requirement of the project is the implementation of a server. At this time it is unknown how much time the implementation of these features will take. This results in a tight schedule. The following features are more prone to complications:
- User login
- Sending images; Answer glimp and profile picture
- Push notifications
- Cropping images to a square

### Planning
| Week | Schedule | Features |
|:------:|:------:|---------|
|1 | Prototype UI | Set up views, basic interface elements/controllers, log in, add and see friends. |
|2 | Beta version | Ask for a glimp, answer a glimp, profile pictures, shared glimps view |
|3 | Minimum Viable Product | Push notifications, profile view, delayed features |
|4 | Final release | Clean up code and refactor where necessary |
